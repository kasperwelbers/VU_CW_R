The first thing you want to do is open an R Script (!!) to work in. To do so, go to the toolbar and select File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Script.\nYou will now see four windows split evenly over the four corners of your screen:\nWhile you can directly enter code into your console (bottom-left), you should always work with R scripts (top-left). This allows you to keep track of what you are doing and save every step."

This can be done in two ways:\n\nIf you select a piece of text (so that it is highlighted) you can press Ctrl + Enter to run the selection. For example, select the first three lines (the three mathematical operations) and press Ctrl + Enter.\nIf you haven’t made a selection, but your text cursor is in the editor, you can press Ctrl + Enter to run the line where the cursor is at. This will also move the cursor to the next line, so you can walk through the code from top to bottom, running each line. Try starting on the first line, and pressing Ctrl + Enter six times, to run each line separately."

You also saw that the function sum(1,2,3,4,5) evaluates to 15 (the sum of the numbers). We’ll address how to use R as a calculator and how to perform functions at a later time. For now, one more thing that you need to know about the R syntax is how values can be assigned to names.\nIn plain terms, assignment is how you make R remember things by assigning them to a name. This works the same way for all sorts of values, from single numbers to entire datasets. You can choose whether you prefer the equal sign (=) or the arrow (&lt;-) for assignment.\n\nx = 2\ny &lt;- \"some text\"\n\nHere we have remembered the number 2 as x and the text “some text” as y. If you are working in RStudio (which you should), you can now also see these names and values in the topright window, under the “Environment” tab.\nWe can now use the names to retrieve the values, or to use these values in new commands.\n\nx * 5\n\nThis should print the value 10 in your R Console (bottom-left window)"

This is essentially a folder on your computer in which you can store the R files and data for a project that you are working on. While you do not necessarily need a project to work with R, they are very convenient, and we strongly recommend using them.\nTo create a new project, go to the top-right corner of your RStudio window. Look for the button labeled Project: (None). Click on this button, and select New Project. Follow the instructions to create a new directory with a new project. Name the project “R introduction”.\nNow, open a new R script and immediately save it (select File -&gt; Save in the toolbar, or press ctrl-s). Name the file my_first_r_script.r. In the bottom-right corner, under the Files tab, you’ll now see the file added to the project. The extension .r indicates that the file is an R script."
