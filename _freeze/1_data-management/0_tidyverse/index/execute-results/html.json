Some of the most important ones that we'll we using are:\n\n* [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/). An optimized way for structuring *rectangular data* (basically: a spreadsheet of rows and columns)\n* [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/). Functions for manipulating tibbles: select and rename columns, filter rows, mutate values, etc.\n* [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/). Read data into R. \n* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). One of the best visualization tools out there. Check out the [gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/)\n\n::: {.callout-warning title=\"What about the 'Conflicts'?\" collapse=\"true\"}\nWhen opening the tidyverse, and when opening packages in general, you can get a `Conflicts` warning. \nA very common warning for the tidyverse is:\n\n```\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n```\n\nSo what does this mean, and should we be worried?\n\nSince anyone can write new packages for R, it can happen that two packages provide functions with the same name.\nIn this example, we see that the `filter` function exists in both the `dplyr` package (which we opened by opening the tidyverse), and in the `stats` package (which is included in base R).\nSo now R needs to decide which version of the function to use when you type `filter()`.\nIn this case, it says that the `dplyr::filter()` **masks** `stats::filter()`, meaning that it will now use the `dplyr` version.\n\nIn practice, this will rarely be a problem, because you seldom need two versions of a function in the same script.\nBut if you ever do, there is a simple solution. Instead of just using `filter()`, you can type `dplyr::filter()` to specifically use this version.\nIn the following code, we use this notation to specifically open the help page for `dplyr::filter` and `stats::filter`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?dplyr::filter()\n?stats::filter()\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::",
